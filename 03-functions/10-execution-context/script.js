// Execution context is a special environment created by the JS engine in the browser
// or the v8 engine that node.js uses.

// When created, the global execution context is created, when a function is created,
// a function context is created, for the duration of that function

// JS is a single threaded language.
// Code is executed line by line

// It is also synchronous, at it's core.

// Memory creation phase is one swoop through before code is run
//1.  created the global object called window
